# Introduction

This report explores the Spambase dataset of the UCI Irevine Machine learning Repository. The 
Spambase dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for the classification of emails as spam or 
non-spam. This dataset contains a total of 4601 email messages, which are classified into two 
classes - spam and non-spam. The dataset provides a range of attributes that capture different 
aspects of the emails' content, such as the frequency of specific words, characters, and 
punctuation marks.
This report aims to showcase the performance of KNN and Decision Trees models on the task of 
email classification and provide insights into the optimal strategies for preparing the corpus 
dataset for model implementation purposes.
